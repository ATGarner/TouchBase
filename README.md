Android Messenger Application

Published June 2015

This application was my senior project for my Computer Science Degree at Walla Walla University in June of 2015.

This app allows messaging between users of the app. It is currently only available for Android.Users log in using a Google account which is logged in on the device. The app communicates with a webserver and then receives responses over an https connection or through Google Cloud Messaging. The app is designed for ease of use and simplicity. As such, there are no over the top features or distracting graphics, and the interface is easy and intuitive. The three main pages of the app are all easily accesed by swiping. All but the log in and profile page are contained within one activity.
